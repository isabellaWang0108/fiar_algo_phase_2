    "#### Extract\n",
    "Download the following tables - [Data Source](http://www.cp.jku.at/datasets/LFM-2b/)\n",
    "1. `lyrics-features.json.bz2` (full version) (~6.1GB)\n",
    "2. `user_track_playcount.zip` (Adapted for Track Recommendation) (~8.6GB)\n",
    "3. `song_ids.zip` (Adapted for Track Recommendation) (~2.6GB)\n",
    "4. `user_demographics.zip` (Adapted for Track Recommendation) (4.0MB)\n",
    "\n",
    "`lyrics-features.json.bz2` must first be extracted into a `.json` file. Since I use a windows device, I used 7-Zip. These files are too large, so I enter them into a PostgreSQL database through DBeaver. However, `.json` files are not accepted in PostgreSQL, So I write a Python script to convert the `.json` into a `.csv` file. The file is quite large because there is a BERT embedding vector representation of the lyrics for every song. I exclude the BERT embedding when converting the JSON to a CSV, and instead save the BERT embedding to a `.pt` file so that it may be utilized for modeling and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The three other data tables must also be converted into a CSV file because the columns are not labeled neatly. So, I write another python script to convert `.tsv` files into `.csv`. Entering column names is programed manually into the script, as these files are too large to edit within Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Transform\n",
    "Next, I hop into SQL and do the following:\n",
    "1. Create the tables\n",
    "2. Import the data\n",
    "3. Determined the primary & foreign keys\n",
    "4. Merge\n",
    "5. Sample\n",
    "6. Export\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### More Extracting\n",
    "Now remember, we still have the BERT embeddings. This embedding file is a `.pt` file. Since we've sampled the data, I go back and I recreate the `.pt` file, ensuring that only songs that are accounted for in the sample are included in the word embedding. A song's embedding can be accessed via the key,\n",
    "\n",
    "`key = f\"{json_obj['_id']['artist']} - {json_obj['_id']['track']}\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "that is, `artist - track` is the key. This embedding is only a numeric representation of the lyrics meant to be able to quantify the text data as a function of direction and magnitude with respect to the english language. Each song's lyrics can be defined as a vector in space. We can use cosine similarity to see how similar two vectors (or lyrics) are. In this case, we'll use it to build a recommendation model\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find all the helper files in the drive. The original tables are obviously too large to import into Google Drive, but you can download them yourself and run the scripts from there. Just ensure you have enough space, and double check file paths in the Python code.\n",
